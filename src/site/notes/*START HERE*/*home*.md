# ABOUT

Hi, I'm Courtney! Welcome to my digital garden, where I take public notes, collect insights, and curate resources to better organize my life. All my life, I've had issues with executive function and brain fog, so I imagine that as I keep tending to this, I'll figure out how I can make a system that best works for me.

I recently graduated from Duke University, where I majored in Music and Computer Science and studied jazz and classical voice, piano, and organ. I also spent the spring semester of my junior year in Vienna, Austria.

Follow me as I:
- design a rigorous and interdisciplinary [[*START HERE*/my open source masters\|masters]] program through self-study
- develop and refine my creative process
- document real and honest progress towards personal goals
- discover new and intimate ways of sharing value on the internet with content
