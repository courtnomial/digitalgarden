# this is what it's all about

Hi, it's Courtney. Welcome to my digital garden, where I give a good and honest attempt to organize my mind. I imagine that, as I keep tending to this tiny patch of the Internet, I'll gradually develop systems and frameworks that'll help me work through the noise I've accumulated over a lifetime of brain fog and executive dysfunction. Maybe it'll help you too.

Feel free to follow along as I:
- design a rigorous self-study [[ABOUT/my open source masters\|"masters"]] 
- develop and refine my [[REMINDERS/tips on the creative process\|creative process]]
- [[QUILTED QUAVERS/content creation\|document]] real and honest progress towards general [[wellness as means to an end\|wellness]]

# wait, who am i?

I recently graduated from Duke University, where I majored in Music and Computer Science and studied jazz and classical voice, piano, and organ. I spent the spring semester of my junior year in Vienna, Austria. I'm currently open to freelance work and full-time junior roles.
